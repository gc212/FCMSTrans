# FCMSTrans
FCMSTrans: Many diseases of genetic origin originate from non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). These cause changes in the final protein product encoded by a gene. Through large scale sequencing and population studies, there is growing availability of information on which variations are tolerated and which are not. Variant effect predictors use a wide range of information about such variations to predict their effect, often focusing on evolutionary information. Herein, a novel amino acid substitution variant effect predictor is developed.Based on protein evolutionary information, predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, disorder of the query protein, and contextual sequence features extracted from ESM and ProtTrans pre-trained models, we have developed FCMSTrans as a new computational framework for predicting non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs).The model achieves excellent performance on three benchmark datasets.
